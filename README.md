# Personal Portfolio Website

It has been a few months since ive used my css and html skills, so i thought it would be a good refresher to create a website from scratch with some animations and functionality with js and node.js. This website will be the first step in my goal of making a completely new website that displays the average price of btc, eth, and stable coins across various crypto exchanges to show which exchange has the most deviation from the mean and allowing users to get better discounts on their crypto. I want to add many more features in that website but i wont go further into detail. My portfolio webiste will be a hub for my resume, personal projects, and contact info.


# front-end

I used scss, hmtl, and react to create my front end. I wanted to have 3 tabs in my nav bar to start out. 1.) Home, 2.) About, 3.) Contact info. I plan on adding 2 more for my resume and projects. I wanted to create a clean, yet simplistic website to show of my front end coding skills. I also wanted to include an animation that shows all the languages i have learned and am most proficient in. I used react to make getting api calls much easier, importing packages,  and helping make the entire process much more smooth

# back-end

for back end i used javascript and node.js to write scripts and functions to make my webpage interactable. At this time, i was much more comfotrable with my js skills compared to my html and css skills so it was much more straight forward for me.
